When setting up a parallel path,

Job11 -> Job12 -> Job13 -> Job1Wait
					[Converge Here based on a decision(decision value is configured inside an assignment task)]
Job21 -> Job22 -> Job23 -> Job2Wait


Suppose if Job12 fails then jump directly to the Job1Wait, then all the jobs related to Job1 sequence will be skipped and it will wait there until
the remaining jobs are finished. 

After all the jobs are finished then based on a decision, throw and exit.


If the jobs are in parallel use a jump to jump to the last of the parallel path upon failure.
If the jobs are in parallel use a jump to jump to the next job (i.e. StartJob step of the next job) upon SUCCESS or ERROR-HOLD or InActive.

If the jobs are in sequence use an end to end to the task flow execution upon failure.
If the jobs are in sequence use a jump to jump to the next job (i.e. StartJob step of the next job) in the task flow upon SUCCESS or ERROR-HOLD or InActive.
